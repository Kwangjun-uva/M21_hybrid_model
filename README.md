# Interactive tool for SNN-PC
This Jupyter Notebook code demonstrates the performance of 3-layer spiking neural network for predictive coding (SNN-PC; i.e., the hybrid model of subsection 2.2.1 in D2.3). 

A user can select an MNIST sample, which the network has never seen before but can still make infererence based on other MNIST samples on which it has been trained,
